-> It was a time series data with periodicity of 1 month. \
-> YearMonth column had the year and month details. \
-> Sales column had the cumulative sales for the corresponding month. \
-> Data was read using pandas and plotted using seaborn to visualise. \
-> Statistical Analysis was done and insights were drawn. \
-> Time series data was decomposed into trend and seasonality using both additive and multiplicative seasonality and visualised. \
-> Multiple prediction models such as Regression, Navive Forecast, Simple Average, SES, DES, TES-A, TES-M, ARIMA, SARIMA, etc. \
-> Performance for various models was compared using RMSE scores. \
-> Data for next 12 months was predicted. \
-> Insights were drawn from the prediction and reported.
